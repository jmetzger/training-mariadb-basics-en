# InnoDB 

## Innodb buffer pool

  * How much data fits into memory 
  * Free buffers = pages of 16 Kbytes 
  * Free buffer * 16Kbytes = free innodb buffer pool in KByte  
```
pager grep -i 'free buffers'
show engine innodb status \G
Free buffers       7905
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

```
show status like '%free%';
```



## Overview innodb server variables / settings 

  * https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html

## Change innodb_buffer_pool 

```
# /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf 
# 70-80% of memory on dedicated mysql
[mysqld]
innodb-buffer-pool-size=4.2G
```

```
#
systemctl restart mariadb 
```

```
# 
mysql
mysql>show variables like 'innodb%buffer%';
```

## innodb_flush_method 

```
Ideally O_DIRECT on Linux, but please test it, if it really works well. 
```

## 	innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit

```
When is fliushing done from innodb_log_buffer to log.
Default: 1 : After every commit 
-> best performance 2. -> once per second

# Good to use 2, if you are willing to loose 1 second of data on powerfail 
```

## innodb_flush_neighbors 

```
# on ssd disks set this to off, because there is no performance improvement 
innodb_flush_neighbors=0 

# Default = 1 

```

## skip-name-resolv.conf 

```
# work only with ip's - better for performance 
/etc/my.cnf 
skip-name-resolve
```
