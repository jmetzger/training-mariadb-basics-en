# Joins - Overview 

## What is a JOIN for ? 

 * combines rows from two or more tables
 * based on a related column between them.

## MySQL/MariaDB (Inner) Join 

![Inner Join](/images/img_innerjoin.gif)

## MySQL/MariaDB (Inner) Join (explained) 

  * Inner Join and Join are the same
  * Returns records that have matching values in both tables
  * Inner Join, Cross Join and Join 
    * are the same in MySQL
 
## MySQL/MariaDB Left Join 

![Image Left Join](/images/img_leftjoin.gif)

## MySQL/MariaDB Left (outer) Join (explained) 

  * Return all records from the left table
  * _AND_ the matched records from the right table
  * The result is NULL on the right side
    * if there are no matched columns on the right 
  * Left Join and Left Outer Join are the same

## MySQL Right Join

## MySQL Right Join (explained)  

  * Return all records from the right table
    * _AND_ the matched records from the left table
  * Right Join and Right Outer Join are the same

## MySQL Straight Join 

  * MySQL (inner) Join and Straight Join are the same
  * **Difference:**
    * The left column is always read first
  * **Downside:**
    * Bad optimization through mysql (query optimizer) 
  * **Recommendation:**
    * Avoid straight join if possible 
    * use join instead 
  
## Type of Joins 

  * [inner] join
    * **inner join** and **join** are the same  
  * left [outer] join 
  * right [outer] join
  * full [outer] join
  * straight join < equals > join
  * cross join = join (in mysql)
  * natural join <= equals => join (but syntax is different)

## In Detail: [INNER] JOIN 

  * Return rows when there 
    * is a match in both tables 
  * Example 

```
SELECT actor.first_name, actor.last_name, film.title 
FROM film_actor 
INNER JOIN actor ON film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id 
INNER JOIN film ON film_actor.film_id = film.film_id;
```

## In Detail: Joining without JOIN - Keyword

  * Explanation: Will have the same query execution plan as [INNER] JOIN
```
SELECT actor.first_name, actor.last_name, film.title 
FROM film_actor,actor,film 
where film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id 
and film_actor.film_id = film.film_id;
```

## In Detail: Left Join

  * Return all rows from the left side
    * even if there is not result on the right side
  * Example 
```
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.first_name, 
    c.last_name,
    a.actor_id,
    a.first_name,
    a.last_name
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN actor a 
ON c.last_name = a.last_name
ORDER BY c.last_name;
```

## In Detail: Right Join 

  * Return all rows from the right side
    * even if there are no results on the left side
  * Example 
```
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.first_name, 
    c.last_name,
    a.actor_id,
    a.first_name,
    a.last_name
FROM customer c
RIGHT JOIN actor a 
ON c.last_name = a.last_name
ORDER BY a.last_name;
```

## In Detail: Having  

  * Simple: WHERE for GroupBy (because where does not work here)
  * Example 
```
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM sakila.actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING count(last_name) > 2
```
 
## Internal (type of joins)  - NLJ 

  * NLJ - (Nested Loop Join) 
```
for each row in t1 matching range {
  for each row in t2 matching reference key {
    for each row in t3 {
      if row satisfies join conditions, send to client
    }
  }
}
```

## Internal (type of joins) - BNL 
 
  * BNL - (Block Nested Loop) 
    * in explain: -> using join buffer 
    * columns of interest to a join are stored in join buffer
      * --> not whole rows.
    * join_buffer_size system variable 
      * -> determines the size of each join buffer used to process a query. 
  * https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/nested-loop-joins.html

## BNL - Who can I see, if it is used ? 

  * Can be seen in explain 
![Image Proof Nested Loop](/images/proof-nested-loop.png)

```

explain SELECT a.* FROM actor a  INNER JOIN actor b where a.actor_id > 20 and b.actor_id < 20

```

```
When using a Block Nested-Loop Join, MySQL will, instead of automatically joining t2, 
insert as many rows from t1 that it can into a join buffer 
and then scan the appropriate range of t2 once, 
matching each record in t2 to the join buffer. 
From here, each matched row is then sent to the next join, 
which, as previously discussed, may be another table, 
t3, or, if t2 is the last table in the query, 
the rows may be sent to the network.
```
