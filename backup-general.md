# Backup - General 

## Define your goal 

  * Full backup of database-server (specific to PIT - point-in-time)  
  * Simply backup some specific databases (with data) - ( e.g. 1 database out of 20) 
    * Backup Structure and Data seperately in multiple files - (For further work - e.g. for developers) 
    * Extract data from a specific table (because of problems that came up)
